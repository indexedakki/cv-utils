2025-06-12 10:39:45 [DEBUG] __main__: Assistant response: The task of extracting metadata such as owner and category from 'extra_data.txt' involves processing the file itself. This is fundamentally a file handling task and is not related to searching for candidates. To accomplish this, one would typically use file handling techniques or scripts to open the file, read its contents, and parse the necessary information to extract the metadata. This might involve looking for specific keywords or patterns in the file that indicate the owner and category details. Depending on the file format, various programming languages and tools can be used to automate this process efficiently.
